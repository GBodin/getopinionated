Little getting to-know-django-project. Together with some friends, making an online vote system, possible for use with the pirate party in Belgium.

Django specifics:
-----------------

This project is currently being developed on django. We are using the latest official release, being django 1.4.3. You can get it from https://www.djangoproject.com/download/.

To run the development server, run `srv.py`. This will create the database, populate it with the data in `testdata.json` and execute `./manage.py runserver`.
