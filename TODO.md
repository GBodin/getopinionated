- karma is collected 
    - by upvotes on your comments from other users
    - by posting proposals and getting them accepted
    - by voting on issues regularly
- karma could be more complex than just a number, e.g. funny, insightfull, troll, etc...
- your comments are rendered differently according to your karma and/or the comment status (funny, insightfull, troll)
- users with troll karma get their comments read out (audio, text2speech) before they can commit. (xkcd ref)
- read out new comments over audio while they come in so you can read the text and hear the comments coming it.
